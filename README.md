# movie-recommender-system
A content-based movie recommendation system using Python and TF-IDF.

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using
Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TF-IDF vectorization, and Cosine Similarity.

## How it works
- The model reads a dataset of movies
- Converts movie descriptions into TF-IDF vectors
- Computes cosine similarity between movies
- Recommends movies based on similarity of descriptions

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity
