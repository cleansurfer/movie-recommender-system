# movie-recommender-system
A content-based movie recommendation system using Python and TF-IDF.
I built a content-based movie recommendation system using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Implemented TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on overview similarity within the TMDB 5000 movies dataset.
